Hello! This is my project called EstateVerse. EstateVerse is a full stack real estate listing application created with MERN. 
To run with a terminal change directories to client and type 'npm run dev' 
as well as have a split terminal with the directory being the root folder and use npm run dev.
Thank you and I hope you enjoy.
